[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) server is used for processing and storing community help requests for Give+Seek, a platform for human connection and support.

The server is hosted on [Heroku](https://giveandseek.herokuapp.com/). The server was hosted on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) while it was active during the hackathon.

## Setup

First, install NodeJS.

Install the required dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```

Start the server locally:
```shell
npm start
```

The server will be running on http://localhost:3000/. so click on the link or copy-paste it on a browser.

## API

For details on the REST API used to contact the server, refer to [the repository wiki](https://github.com/nwHacks2019/backend/wiki/API-Documentation).
